# Dogwood Creative Gulp QuickStart
This is our base-line Gulp starter. Nothing fancy, just the most basic Gulp setup we use on a daily basis.

## There are no Node Modules?
There are plenty of Node Modules included, we just left them out of our Git repo. Once you download the files, do a quick 'npm install' in your terminal. This will install all of the required modules into your project.

## Where should I put my files?
Put all of your raw files (SASS, JS, HTML, etc.) in the 'app' directory. Gulp will then compile all of your files in the 'build' directory. The server will then serve the fies from that directory (hint. hint. When uploading your files to a server, only include the ones inside that 'build' folder).

## Why Gulp over Grunt or Broccoli?
